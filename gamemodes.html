      <div>
        <h3>Unrated</h3>
        <p>Unrated is VALORANT's standard Plant/Defuse mode. Teams play 12 rounds on Attack or Defense, then swap to the other side for the next 12 rounds. The first to 13 rounds wins (best-of-25), with a final Endgame round played should the game reach a 12-12 scoreline.</p>
      </div>

<div class="item">
      <div>
        <h3>Competitive</h3>
        <p>Competitive is a higher stakes version of Unrated where you play competitively against other players to earn and compete for a rank. Should a game reach a 12-12 scoreline, the games instead goes into Overtime where the first team to get a 2-round lead on their opponent wins the game. Players can vote every two rounds on whether to continue Overtime, which can result in the game going on for longer or ending in a draw should enough players vote for either option.</p>

    <div class="item">
      <div>
        <h3>Swiftplay</h3>
        <p>Swiftplay is a best-of-nine mode. It has most of the same gameplay rules as Unrated, but adapted for a shorter match length.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <div>
        <h3>Spike Rush</h3>
        <p>Spike Rush is a best-of-seven mode where all players start each round with the same random weapon. Random orbs spawn around the map that players can collect to grant buff for themselves and/or their teammates or afflict enemies with debuffs.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <div>
        <h3>Deathmatch</h3>
        <p>Deathmatch is a 12-player free-for-all game mode designed to allow players to hone their gunplay mechanics without abilities or warm up before playing Competitive. Players equip weapons of their choice and kill anyone in their way until either a player reaches 40 kills or 9 minutes have passed, at which point the game will end.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <div>
        <h3>Escalation</h3>
        <p>Escalation is a 5v5 team deathmatch mode where players kill and race the enemy team through a cycle of different weapons and abilities, advancing together as a team through Escalation levels. The first team to finish level 12, or the furthest along in 10 minutes, wins the game. Each level has a specific weapon or ability that the player is equipped with. Killing enemies grants points for the team that help to advance levels.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="item">
      <div>
        <h3>Team Deathmath</h3>
        <p>Team Deathmatch is a 5v5 team deathmatch mode where the first team to 100 kills wins. Players choose their loadouts based on the stage their team is at. Abilities regenerate over time instead of purchasing them with creds. There are Weapon Spawners throughout the map that give you weapons different from your loadout. Recovery Orbs appear throughout the map that recover the team's health and shield. Ultimate Orbs also appear to charge up a percentage of your Ultimate.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Snowball Fight</h3>
        <p>Snowball Fight was a 5v5 team deathmatch mode where the first team to 50 kills wins. All players only have access to a Snowball Launcher that fires lethal projectile-based snowballs. Gifts also appear on the map that contain temporary power ups for the player. These can increase the launcher's rate of fire, increase snowball size, let snowballs ricochet, or increase the player's movement speed and max jump height.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <div>
        <h3>Replication</h3>
        <p>Replication was a best-of-nine mode where all players on a team play as the same agent. Players vote for an agent they want to play and the game then randomly selects one of the choices.</p>
